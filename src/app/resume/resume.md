_Idle clicker game with a frontend built in Svelte and a backend in Go. Svelte
provided a very easy user experience and allowed me to avoid some of the
pitfalls of managing intervals and timeouts in React. Go was selected for the
backend due to its performance and developer experience. This project was very
challenging as it required me to learn much more about how to optimize
JavaScript code as the game performs a large amount of calculations on the
client._

- Back-end written in Go to handle saving/loading user data.
- UI written in Svelte to provide an elegant and modern
  user experience.
