# bduck.dev

This is the code for my personal website which can be found
👉[bduck.dev](https://bduck.dev)

Focused on being fast, simple, and server-driven by using Go, Templ, and HTMX.

## Features

- Projects page with the stuff I've built, my thought process, and how I approached the development process.
- Blogs page with everything from tutorials to hot takes.
- Dockerfile for easy containerized building and deployment.
- Partial updates, snappy page transitions.

## Stack

- Go + Chi - backend and routing
- Templ - HTML templating
- HTMX - Enables modern interactivity
- Goldmark - Markdown to HTML rendering for posts

## TODO

-[ ] Proper post sorting using real date metadata instead of naive string comparison. -[ ] Make html metadata a separate component so that page layout can have author metadata on blog post.
